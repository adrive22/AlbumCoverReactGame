# AlbumCoverReactGame

This React web game uses images stored in a JSON file and shuffles them in random order everytime one of the images is clicked. If you click the same image twice, then you will be alerted and the score will be reset. This game also records the highest score that you have achived overall while you are still on the same page. This game was created using create-react-app.
